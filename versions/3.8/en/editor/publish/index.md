# Publish to Multiple Platforms

Thanks to the Cocos Creator's dual-core engine architecture (the C++ core is for native platforms and the TS core is for web and mini-game platform), projects created with Cocos Creator can run smoothly on native, web, and mini-game platforms. This truly achieves the goal of developing once, run everywhere.
