# Shader Syntax

Shaders in Cocos Creator are called Cocos Shaders, and have the file extension `*.effect`. It consists of [YAML](yaml-101.md) and [GLSL](glsl.md). The YAML is used for the flow control instructions, while the GLSL is for the shader code. These two parts complement each other to form a complete Cocos Shader.

> **Note**: It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code to write Cocos Shader and install the Cocos Effect extension from the marketplace in Visual Studio Code to provide syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

## Syntax Overview

A **Cocos Shader** typically consists of two parts.

- `CCEffect`: Used to declare techniques, passes, render states, properties, etc.
- `CCProgram`: Used for shader code, such as the vs, fs, uniforms, etc.

Let's explore the syntax of Cocos Shader by taking the built-in shader `builtin-unlit.effect` as an example.

In VS Code, Open the `builtin-unlit.effect` file located in the `internal/effects/` folder.

```ts
CCEffect %{
  techniques:
  - name: opaque
    passes:
      - vert: unlit-vs:vert
      - frag: unlit-fs:frag
        properties: &props
        mainTexture:    { value: grey }
        tilingOffset:   { value: [1, 1, 0, 0] }
        mainColor:      { value: [1, 1, 1, 1], linear: true, editor: { type: color } }
        colorScale:     { value: [1, 1, 1], target: colorScaleAndCutoff.xyz }
        alphaThreshold: { value: 0.5, target: colorScaleAndCutoff.w, editor: { parent: USE_ALPHA_TEST } }
        ...
  - name: transparent
    passes:
      - vert: unlit-vs:vert
      - frag: unlit-fs:frag
        depthStencilState: &d1
        ...
}%

CCProgram unlit-vs %{
  precision highp float;
  #include <...>
  #cinlude <....>

  vec4 vert(){
    vec4 position;
    CCVertInput(position);
    ....
    return cc_matProj * (cc_matView * matWorld) * position;
  }
}%

CCProgram unlit-fs %{
  precision highp float;
  #include <...>
  #cinlude <....>

  vec4 frag(){
    vec4 o = mainColor;
    ....
    return CCFragOutput(o);
  }
}%

```

## CCEffect

The section wrapped by `CCEffect` in Cocos Shader contains the description of the rendering process declared using **YAML**. Developers who are unfamiliar with YAML can refer to [YAML 101](yaml-101.md) for more details.

The overall structure of `CCEffect` is as follows.

```glsl
CCEffect %{
  techniques:
  - name: tag
    passes:
    - vert: vs:entry
      frag: fs:entry
      <optional: material properties>
      <optional: pipeline states>
      <optional: one or more definitions>
    ...
  ...
}%
```

A `CCEffect` can declare multiple techniques, but only one can be applied to a material instance during rendering.

Taking `builtin-unlit.effect` as an example, it contains the following 4 techniques.
- opaque
- transparent
- add
- alpha-blend

The `opaque` technique is specifically used for rendering opaque objects, while the `transparent`, `transparent`, `add` and `alpha-blend` are used for rendering transparent objects.

Each technique includes a name and one or more render passes.

The name is used to describe the purpose of the render technique, and the passes defines all the necessary information for a complete render call.

## Pass

The characteristics of a render pass are as follows.

1. A render technique can contain multiple render passes, and the passes are executed one by one in the defined order.
2. A render pass must include a vertex shader and a fragment shader, while the rest are optional. For details, please refer to [Pass Optional Parameters](pass-parameter-list.md)。
3. The VS/FS shaders need to specify the **CCProgram** to use and specify the entry function of the shader. If the entry function is not specified, the default entry 'main' will be used.

**The format is as follows**：

```glsl
CCEffect %{
  techniques:
  - name: opaque # Define an opaque render technique
    passes:
    - vert: vs: entry # Select a vertex shader defined in CCProgram, with the entry function.
      frag: fs: entry # Select a fragment shader defined in CCProgram, with the entry function.
    ...
  ...
}%
```

Each render pass has only one `vert` and one `frag`, which are used to declare the vertex shader and fragment shader used in the current pass. The format is `ShaderName: EntryFunctionName`.

The `ShaderName` can be a fragment name declared in the current shader file or a standard header file (*.chunk) provided by the engine.

> **Note**: The customized shader should not use the `main` function. Cocos Shader automatically adds a `main` function during compilation and calls the entry function (e.g. `vert` of `frag` ) of the render pass. The `main` function will use the return value of the entry function as the output of the current shader.

## Render Pass Properties

Properties in a render pass are used to configure related uniforms for the shader code. Through properties, you can define how a uniform is displayed in the panel. Here's an example.

```glsl
CCEffect %{
  techniques:
  - name: opaque
    passes:
    - vert: vs: entry 
      frag: fs: entry
      properties:
        mainTexture: { value: grey }
        colorScale: { value: [1, 1, 1], target: colorScaleAndCutoff.xyz }
      depthStencilState:
        depthTest: true
        depthWrite: true
    ...
  ...
}%
```

For more details, please refer to [Pass Optional Parameters](pass-parameter-list.md)。

## CCProgram

The section wrapped by `CCProgram` in Cocos Shader is declared using **GLSL** for the shader code. It is recommended to have a basic understanding of [GLSL Basic](./glsl.md).

```glsl
CCProgram shader-name %{
  <required: precision settings>
  <optional: include>  
  <optional: ubo>
  <optional: custom attribute>
  <optional: >
  vec4 entry(){
    // Should return a vec4 type data.
  }
}%
```

## Macros

By using macros, you can control code branches and combinations during the compilation of Cocos Shader, enabling efficient and convenient management of shader code.

For more detailed information, please refer to.

- [Macros](macros.md)
- [GLSL Basic](glsl.md)
