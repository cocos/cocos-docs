# AudioSource Component Reference

The AudioSource component is used to control the playback of music and sound effects.

Select the node in the **Hierarchy** panel, then click the **Add Component** button at the bottom of the **Inspector** panel and select **Audio -> AudioSource** to add the AudioSource component to the node.

## AudioSource Properties

| Property | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Clip | The added [audio asset](../asset/audio.md) for playback , default is empty, click the arrow button behind it to select. |
| Loop | Whether to loop. |
| PlayOnAwake | Whether the audio will be played automatically when the game is running (component is active). |
| Volume | Volume, in the range 0~1. |

## Audio Playback

Cocos Creator 3.x uses AudioSource to control the playback of audio, which is a component that can be added to the scene, set by the **Editor**, or called in a **script**.

In addition, Creator divides audio into longer **music** and shorter **sound effects** based on their length.

- If you control audio playback through the editor, there is no difference between playing music and sound effects, but long music is recommended. See the **Playback via Editor** section below for details.
- If audio playback is controlled via script, the AudioSource component additionally provides the `playOneShot` interface for playing short sound effects, see the **Sound Effect Playback** section below for details.

> **Note**: Cocos Creator 3.x removes the `audioEngine` API from v2.x and uses the AudioSource component for audio playback.

### Via the editor

1. Add the AudioSource component to the node.

2. Drag and drop the required audio asset from the **Assets** panel into the **Clip** property box of the AudioSource component as follows:

    ![audioClip](audio/audiocilp.gif)

3. Set the other properties of the AudioSource component as needed.

### Via script

For more flexible control of AudioSource playback, you can add a custom script to the node where the **AudioSource component** is located and then call the appropriate API to control audio playback.

1. Add the AudioSource component to the node and specify the audio asset.

2. [Create script](../scripting/setup.md) in the **Assets** panel and name it (e.g. `AudioController`), then double-click to open the script for writing, as follows:

    ```typescript
    import { _decorator, Component, Node, AudioSource, assert } from 'cc';
    const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

    @ccclass("AudioController")
    export class AudioController extends Component { 
    
        @property(AudioSource)
        public _audioSource: AudioSource = null!

        onLoad () {
            // Get the AudioSource component
            const audioSource = this.node.getComponent(AudioSource)! ;
            // Check if it contains AudioSource, if not, output an error message
            assert(audioSource);
            // Assign the component to the global variable _audioSource
            this._audioSource = audioSource;
        }

        play () {
            // Play the music
            this._audioSource.play();
        }

        pause () {
            // Pause the music
            this._audioSource.pause();
        }
    }
    ```

3. Select the node in the **Hierarchy** panel, then drag and drop the script from the **Assets** panel to the **Inspector** panel to add the script component to the node. As shown below:

    ![audioSource](audio/audiocontroller.png)

#### Audio Playback

Compared to long music playback, sound effect playback has the following characteristics:

- Short playback time
- Large number of simultaneous playback

The **AudioSource** component provides the `playOneShot` interface to play sound effects. The specific code implementation is as follows:

```typescript
// AudioController.ts

import { AudioClip, AudioSource, Component, _decorator } from 'cc';
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

@ccclass("AudioController")
export class AudioController extends Component {     

    @property(AudioClip)
    public clip: AudioClip = null!   

    @property(AudioSource)
    public audioSource: AudioSource = null!

    playOneShot () {
        this.audioSource.playOneShot(this.clip, 1);
    }
}
```

> **Note**: `playOneShot` is a one-time play operation, the sound after playing cannot be paused or stopped, and cannot listen to the end-of-play event callback.

For more audio-related scripting interfaces, please refer to [AudioSource API](__APIDOC__/en/class/AudioSource).

For more control over audio playback, please refer to the [AudioSource playback example](./audioExample.md) documentation.

## Register AudioSource Event Callback

Cocos Creator supports registering event callbacks on AudioSource components, with the following usage examples:

```typescript
import { _decorator, Component, Node, AudioSource } from 'cc';
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

@ccclass('AudioDemo')
export class AudioDemo extends Component {

    @property(AudioSource)
    audioSource: AudioSource = null!;

    onEnable () {
        // Register the started event callback
        this.audioSource.node.on(AudioSource.EventType.STARTED, this.onAudioStarted, this);
        // Register the ended event callback
        this.audioSource.node.on(AudioSource.EventType.ENDED, this.onAudioEnded, this);
    }

    onDisable () {
        this.audioSource.node.off(AudioSource.EventType.STARTED, this.onAudioStarted, this);
        this.audioSource.node.off(AudioSource.EventType.ENDED, this.onAudioEnded, this);
    }

    onAudioStarted () {
        // TODO...
    }

    onAudioEnded () {
        // TODO...
    }
}
```

## Web platform playback restrictions

Audio playback on the Web platform currently requires compliance with the latest [Audio Play Policy](https://www.chromium.org/audio-video/autoplay), and even if the **AudioSource** component has `playOnAwake` set, the audio needs to be played manually in the touch event, as follows:

```typescript
// AudioController.ts

import { _decorator, Component, Node, AudioSource, find } from 'cc';
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

@ccclass("AudioController")
export class AudioController extends Component {      

    @property(AudioSource)
    public audioSource: AudioSource = null!

    start () {
        let btnNode = find('BUTTON_NODE_NAME');
        btnNode!.on(Node.EventType.TOUCH_START, this.playAudio, this);
    }
    
    playAudio () {
        this.audioSource.play();
    }
}
```
