# Cocos CreatorXR

Cocos CreatorXR is an XR content creation tool built on top of Cocos Creator and Cocos Engine. It leverages the OpenXR standard protocol to bridge the differences between various XR devices, allowing developers to create and publish content for different XR devices without the need to adapt to specific device features.

The middleware layer provides XR content creation support through a set of XR middleware with different functionalities, allowing users to customize and extend component content. The upper layer extends the Cocos Creator panel to provide various forms of XR function menus and component styles, offering users a more convenient content creation interface.
