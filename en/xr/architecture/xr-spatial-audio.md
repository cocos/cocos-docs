# XR Spatial Audio

XR Spatial Audio is an important technology in the virtual reality field that can simulate audio environments from the real world, providing users with a more immersive auditory experience in virtual reality. **Sound-Tracking** technology based on head-mounted displays can simulate audio environments from the real world by tracking the user's head movements. When users move their heads in a virtual reality environment, the system can adjust the position and direction of the audio based on the user's head movements and position, creating a simulation of real-world audio environments.
