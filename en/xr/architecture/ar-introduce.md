# AR

Cocos CreatorXR extension allows you to create cross-platform Augmented Reality (AR) applications. You can add corresponding AR components to nodes in your scene to choose which AR features to enable, without worrying about the differences between AR SDKs of different platforms. When you build and run the application on an AR device, the underlying AR module of the Cocos Creator engine will invoke the native AR SDK of the device to enable AR functionality. This allows you to develop once and publish to multiple AR platforms.

**Version Requirements**:

- Use Cocos Creator v3.7.1 or higher.
- Use xr-plugin v1.1.0 or higher.
