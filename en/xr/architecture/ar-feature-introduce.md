Developers often need to publish AR applications for different platforms. To mitigate the challenges posed by platform differences, Cocos CreatorXR provides a unified set of high-level AR components to support the design and development of augmented reality applications. When using AR components, developers do not need to worry about the functional differences of various AR SDKs and can focus on business-related development.
