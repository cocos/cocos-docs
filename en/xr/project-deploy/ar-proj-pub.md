## ARKit

For iOS publishing, please refer to the [Build Options - iOS](../../editor/publish/ios/build-options-ios.md). Make sure to configure your developer account in Xcode.

To publish an AR application for the iOS platform, create a new build task and select the `iOS` platform.

For the Application Bundle name, it is recommended to use the same name as the developer account configured in Xcode. Select iPhone OS Application as the target platform and check **Enable AR**.

Click **Build** to generate the Xcode project.

> **Note**: Currently, Cocos Creator only supports building the iOS project. Compilation and running need to be done in Xcode.

After the build is complete, locate the generated `xcodeproj` file and open it with Xcode. Configure the signing and developer team, connect the device, and click Run to run the application.
