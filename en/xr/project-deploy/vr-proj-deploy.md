## Apply XR Extension To An Existing Project

Add XR extension to an existing or empty project: Search for xr-plugin on the Store page in the Dashboard and download and install it for your project. Alternatively, in Cocos Creator, go to **Extensions -> Store** and download and install the extension for your project (installing it globally is not recommended).
