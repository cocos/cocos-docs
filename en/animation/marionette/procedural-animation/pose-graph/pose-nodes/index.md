# Pose Nodes

An animation graph allows you to create a pose node and edit the pose node, the result of which will be stored inside the animation graph as part of the animation graph assets.

You can refer to the Animation Graph usage to create, delete, and modify a pose graph.

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the concepts of pose graphs and their usage.

A pose node outputs a pose. The engine provides pose nodes with the following roles:

- [play-or-sample-animation](./play-or-sample-motion.md)

- [Blend poses](./blend-poses.md)

- [Choose Pose](./choose-pose.md)

- [modify-pose](./modify-pose.md)

- [State Machine](./state-machine.md)

- [Use stashed pose](./use-stashed-pose.md)

For the visualization of the pose graph node editor, see [pose graph node view](./node-operation.md).
