# Get Familiar with the Animation Panel

The **Animation** panel is used to edit and preview the animation clip of the currently selected node. When editing animation data or related properties, it will take effect immediately after mouse focus leaves.

The **Animation** panel is already included in the default layout of Cocos Creator, or open the **Animation** panel by clicking **Panel -> Animation -> Animation Editor** in the main menu above the editor.

## Panel Introduction

The **Animation** panel can be divided into the following main sections.

![animation-editor](animation-editor/animation-panel.png)

1. **Toolbar**: some common function buttons, such as play/pause/stop animation, add event frame, save animation, quit editing, etc.
2. **Node List**: used to display/set the currently selected node and its child nodes.
3. **Animation timeline and Keyframe Preview**: used to display/set the event frames added to the current node (and its children) and the preview of all keyframes on the added animation property.
4. **Animation Property List**: used to display/set all animation properties included in the currently edited animation clip for the currently selected node.
5. **Animation Property Keyframe Preview**: used to display/set all keyframes on each animation property of the currently selected node.
6. **Related properties of the current animation clip**: used to set the playback mode, playback speed, etc. of the current animation clip.

For specific content, please refer to the following introduction.

### 1. Menu Toolbar

The function buttons in the **Menu toolbar** are, from left to right.

### 2. Node list

![node list](animation-editor/2-node-list.png)

This area shows the currently selected animation nodes and their children, arranged in a way that corresponds to the node tree in the **Hierarchy** panel. Click on the top ![hide](animation-editor/hide-node.png) button to hide/show nodes without animation data, or just type the node name in the input box to quickly find the node.

Currently, it is possible to right-click on a node to clear, migrate, copy and paste node data. For details, please refer to the [Common operations on node data](edit-animation-clip.md#common-operations-on-node-data) documentation.

![node operation](animation-editor/node-operation.png)

### 3. Animation timeline and keyframe preview

![animation timeline](animation-editor/animation-timeline.png)

The animation timeline is mainly used to display/set the custom [event frames](animation-event.md) added to the current node, the [keyframes](edit-animation-clip.md) (blue diamond) of all animation properties added to the node (and its children) and to show the preview.

The time control line (red vertical line) indicates the time the current animation is at, and the currently selected time can be changed in several ways:

- Drag and drop the time control line directly
- Double click on the keyframe
- Using the relevant move control buttons in the menu toolbar
- Use shortcut keys, which can be found in the **Shortcuts** section below
- Click anywhere in the upper area of the animation timeline

  ![about the timeline](animation-editor/above-timeline.png)

If the time control line is moved, the nodes in the **Scene** panel will also move accordingly to the animation track.

![move line](animation-editor/move-line.gif)

#### Scale unit display of the timeline

The ![time](animation-editor/menu_time.png) button in the **Toolbar** can be used to toggle the way the scale unit of the timeline is displayed. The value in the input box will change with the movement of the time control line. Manual input is supported, and the time control line will be automatically positioned to the corresponding position after the input is finished.

The following three display methods are currently supported:

- **Time: 0-00** (default): the animation timeline scale is displayed as a combination of seconds and frames. The value in front of the input box means **seconds**, and the value after it means **frames**, for example `01-05` means 1 second and 5 frames.

  ![time](animation-editor/time.png)

- **Frame: 0**: display the scale of the animation timeline in terms of frames.

  ![frame](animation-editor/frame.png)

- **Time(s): 0 s**: display the scale of the animation timeline in seconds.

  ![times](animation-editor/times.png)

The frame rate (Sample) is generally used to indicate how many frames a second is to be divided into, which can be adjusted in the **Sample** option at the bottom of the **Animation** panel. This is affected to a different extent when the scale unit of the timeline is displayed in different ways.

When the scale unit is set to **Frame**, it is in frames and is not affected by the frame rate. <br>
When set to **Time** or **Time(s)**, the same scale represents a different point in time as the frame rate changes, and the conversion between the two is calculated as follows:

| Frame Rate (Sample) | Time: 00-00 | Time (s): 0 s |
| :-- | :--------- | :------------ |
| 30 | 01-05 | 1 + 5/30 = 1.17 s |
| 10 | 01-05 | 1 + 5/10 = 1.5 s |

For example, if the frame rate is set to 30 and a keyframe is added to the `01-05` scale, the keyframe will be at frame 35 after the animation starts. Changing the frame rate to 10, the total number of frames where the keyframe is located does not change, it is still at frame 35 after the start of the animation, and the scale reading at the keyframe location becomes `03-05`, which translates to exactly 3 times the previous time (s).

#### Changing the animation timeline scale

If the **Animation** panel display is too small and needs to be enlarged for more keyframes to be displayed within the editor, Just simply scroll the mouse wheel in either **Animation Timeline** and **Animation Property Keyframe Preview** area to scale the timeline up or down.

![scale](./animation-editor/scale.gif)

#### Moving the animation timeline display area

Drag and drop the middle/right mouse button in any area of the **Animation Timeline** or **Animation Property Keyframe preview** to see the hidden keyframes on the left/right side of the animation timeline that are outside the display area.

### 4. List of animation property

![node list](./animation-editor/4-pro-list.png)

This area is mainly used to display/add/set the animation property of the currently selected node in the current Animation Clip. The animation properties include the node's own properties, component properties (including those in user-defined script components), and the animation properties are added by clicking the **+** button in the upper right corner. Component properties are prefixed with the name of the component, e.g.: `cc.Sprite.spriteFrame`.

Right-click on the animation property or click ![property](./animation-editor/set-pro.png) button to the right of the animation property to select **Remove Prop Track**, **Clear Keyframe Data**, or **Copy Prop Track**. For details, please refer to the [Common operations on animation property data](edit-animation-clip.md#Common-operations-on-animation-property-data) documentation.

![property operation](./animation-editor/pro-operation.png)

### 5. Keyframe preview of the animation property

![animation property track](./animation-editor/animation-property-track.png)

This area is mainly used to display the specific keyframe settings of the currently selected node on each animation property, and is also the main area for keyframe editing. Keyframes can be added by right-clicking on the animation property on the right side. This area also supports the ability to move, copy, and paste keyframes by checking and tapping on them. For details, please refer to the [Common keyframe operations](edit-animation-clip.md#common-keyframe-operations) documentation.

When clicking on a keyframe, it will turn from blue to white and information about it will be displayed above the area, and double-clicking on the keyframe will move the time control line to its location.

![key info](animation-editor/key-info.png)

### 6. Related properties of the current animation clip

The properties of the current Animation Clip that can be set directly on the **Animation** panel include: **WrapMode**, **Sample**, **Speed** and **Duration**. For details, please refer to the [Animation Clip Properties Settings](edit-animation-clip.md#animation-clip-properties-settings) documentation.

## Adjusting the Layout of the Animation Panel

The dividers between the node list and the timeline, and between the property list and the timeline are available for dragging and dropping to change the layout. By dragging and dropping it is possible to freely adjust the **Animation** panel to a layout effect suitable for editing.
