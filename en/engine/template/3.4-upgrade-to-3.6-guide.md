# Project Engineering Upgrade Guide

 - This article will introduce in detail the precautions for upgrading cocos creator 3D game from 3.4~3.4.x to 3.6. The modification is only for the 'native' directory under the project.

### First, open the old project in the new directory with the new version of creator, then build the target platform, and finally refer to the following steps

#### Android Java Modification Points
  
  - game/AppActivity.java
  - game/InstantActivity.java
    - ~~onCreate delete the following code~~
    ```java
          // Workaround in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16283079/re-launch-of-activity-on-home-button-but-only-the-first-time/16447508
          if (!isTaskRoot()) {
              // Android launched another instance of the root activity into an existing task
              //  so just quietly finish and go away, dropping the user back into the activity
              //  at the top of the stack (ie: the last state of this task)
              // Don't need to finish it again since it's finished in super.onCreate .
              return;
          }
    ```

  - app/AndroidManifest.xml
    - delete code: ~~android:taskAffinity=""~~
    - add code: android:exported="true"

  - app/build.gradle 
    - modify code: 
    ``` html
        "${RES_PATH}/assets" -> "${RES_PATH}/data"
    ``` 

#### cpp Modification Points
  - remove file: ~~jni/main.cpp~~
  - replace include file:  #include "cocos/platform/Application.h" —> #include "application/ApplicationManager.h"
  - Change of usage: cc::Application::getInstance()->getScheduler() -> CC_CURRENT_ENGINE()->getScheduler()
  - With custom jsb interfaces: 'native_ptr_to_seval' changed to 'nativevalue_to_se';  delete 'NonRefNativePtrCreatedByCtorMap' related code
  - Classes/Game.cpp If there is no modification, you can directly use the version built by 3.6. If there is modification, you can integrate the modified part into the 3.6 version
  - Classes/Game.h  same as game.cpp file modification suggestions
  - jsb_module_register.cpp   same as game.cpp file modification suggestions


#### CMakeLists.txt Modification Points

   - android/CMakeLists.txt
     - LIB_NAME changed to CC_LIB_NAME
     - PROJ_SOURCES changed to CC_PROJ_SOURCES
     - add code: set(CC_PROJECT_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR})
     - add code: set(CC_COMMON_SOURCES)
     - add code: set(CC_ALL_SOURCES)
     - delete code: 
      ```cmake
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../common/Classes/Game.h
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../common/Classes/Game.cpp
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/jni/main.cpp

            add_library(${LIB_NAME} SHARED ${PROJ_SOURCES})
            target_link_libraries(${LIB_NAME}
              "-Wl,--whole-archive" cocos2d_jni "-Wl,--no-whole-archive"
              cocos2d
            )
            target_include_directories(${LIB_NAME} PRIVATE
              ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../common/Classes
            )
      ``` 
     - add code:
      ```cmake
            cc_android_before_target(${CC_LIB_NAME})
            add_library(${CC_LIB_NAME} SHARED ${CC_ALL_SOURCES})
            # Add user dependent library AAA here.  target_link_libraries(${CC_LIB_NAME} AAA)
            # Add user defined file xxx/include here. target_include_directories(${CC_LIB_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../common/Classes/xxx/include)
            cc_android_after_target(${CC_LIB_NAME})
      ``` 
   - common/CMakeLists.txt
     - TARGET_IOS_VERSION changed to 11.0
     - cocos2d-x-lite/ changed to engine/native/
     - Add code at the end of the file
      ```cmake
        list(APPEND CC_COMMON_SOURCES
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Classes/Game.h
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Classes/Game.cpp
        )
      ```
