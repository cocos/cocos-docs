# Event System

The event system is a common feature that needs to be involved in interaction during game development. The event system can be used not only to send input actions (e.g. keyboard, mouse, touch) to the application in the form of events, but also to respond to things that happen during the game that require the attention of other objects in the form of events. For example, opening the checkout or reward screen after a game victory.

## Use of Events

Events need to be registered to get listened to. You can learn about event listening and emitting through the following documents:

- [Event Listening and Emitting](event-emit.md)

On the basis of event listening and emitting, Cocos Creator supports many built-in event systems, including:

- [Input Event System](event-input.md)
- [Node Event System](event-node.md)
