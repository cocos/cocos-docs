# Scripting

Scripting in Cocos Creator is used to implement user-defined (game) behavior and supports both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** programming languages. Objects in the scene are driven by writing a scripting component and mounting it to a scene node.

During the component scripting process, developers can declare properties to map the variables that need to be adjusted in the script to the **Inspector** panel for game designers and artists to make adjustments. At the same time, it is also possible to register specific callback functions to help initialize, update or even destroy nodes.
