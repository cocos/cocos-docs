# Spotlights

A **Spotlight** is a cone-shaped beam of light emitted from a point in one direction, similar to the light produced by a flashlight or stage lighting. Compared to other lights, spotlights have an additional `SpotAngle` property, which is used to adjust the light range of the spotlight.

In the editor, one can clearly see the position, color and light range of the light as well as its spot angle, as shown in the following image. With the [Transform Gizmos](../../../../editor/toolbar/index.md) in the upper left corner of the editor, it is possible to adjust the position and direction of the spotlight.
