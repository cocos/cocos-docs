# Shadows

In the 3D world, light and shadows have always been extremely important components that enrich the entire environment. High quality shadows can make the game world look more realistic.

Creator 3.0 currently supports two types of shadows, **Planar** and **ShadowMap**.

## Enabling Shadow Effect

To enable the shadow effect for an object, proceed as follows:

1. Check **Scene** in the **Hierarchy** panel, and then check the **Enabled** property in the **Shadows** component of the **Inspector** panel.

2. Select the 3D node that needs to display shadows in the **Hierarchy** panel, and then set the **ShadowCastingMode** property to **ON** in the **MeshRenderer** component of the **Inspector** panel.

    If the type of shadows is **ShadowMap**, set the **ReceiveShadow** property on the **MeshRenderer** component to **ON**.

> **Note**: if shadows are not displayed properly, adjust the direction of the directional light.

## Types of Shadows

The types of shadows can be set in the **Type** property of the **Shadows** component.

### Planar Shadows

The planar shadows are generally used for simpler scenes.

![planar-properties](shadow/plannar-properties.png)

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enabled** | Whether to enable shadow effect. |
| **Type** | The type of shadows. |
| **ShadowColor** | The color of shadows. |
| **Normal** | The normal line perpendicular to shadows, used to adjust the slope of shadows. |
| **Distance** | The distance between the shadow receiving plane and the origin of the coordinate. |

Adjust the direction of the directional light to adjust the position of shadows.

> **Note**: planar shadows are only cast on planar surfaces, not on objects, which means that the **ReceiveShadow** property in the **MeshRenderer** component is invalid.

### ShadowMap

ShadowMap renders the scene with the lights as the viewpoint. From the position of the lights, the places in the scene that are not visible are where shadows are created.

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enabled**         | Whether to enable the shadow effect. |
| **Type**            | Choose the shadow type. |
| **ShadowColor**     | Color value of the resulting shadow. |
| **Pcf**             | Set the anti-aliasing level of the shadow edge, currently including **HARD**, **FILTER_X5**, **FILTER_X9**, **FILTER_X25**. Please refer to the section **PCF Soft Shadow** below for details.  |
| **MaxReceived**     | The maximum number of lights supported for shadow generation, default is 4, can be adjusted as needed.  |
| **Bias**            | Set the offset value of shadows to prevent z-fitting. |
| **Packing**            | ShadowMap compression, which can be enabled for some devices that do not support floating point textures. This optimizes performance, but the texture quality is lower (mutually exclusive with the **Linear** option, only one of the two can be chosen). |
| **Linear**       | Enables linear depth for spotlights only, which can be used to improve the shadow quality of the spotlight (mutually exclusive with **Packing** option).     |
| **SelfShadow**       | Enable the self-shadowing effect for objects in the scene.     |
| **NormalBias**          | Set the normal offset value from **-1 ~ 1**. When **SelfShadow** is enabled, light leakage on curved surfaces can be resolved by adjusting the value of this option (this option is only displayed when **SelfShadow** option is checked).     |
| **AutoAdapt**       | If checked, the range of shadows will be calculated automatically, as described in section **AutoAdapt Adaptive Shadow Calculation** below. If this option is unchecked, the following properties are enabled to manually set the range of shadow generation.  |
| **Near**            | Set the near clipping plane of the main lights shadow camera. |
| **Far**             | Set the far clipping plane of the main lights shadow camera. |
| **OrthoSize**       | Set the ortho viewport size of the main lights shadow camera. |
| **ShadowMapSize**   | Set the texture size of shadows. |
| **Aspect**          | Set the ortho viewport aspect ratio of the main lights shadow camera. |

ShadowMap receives and displays shadow effects generated by other objects when **ReceiveShadow** on the object **MeshRenderer** component is enabled.

ShadowMap is generally used for scenes that require more realistic and complex light and shadow effects. The downside is that if the lights is not moved, then the previously generated ShadowMap can be reused, while once the lights is moved, then a new ShadowMap needs to be recalculated.

#### PCF Soft Shadow

Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) is a simple, common technique used to achieve shadow edge desampling, by smoothing shadow edges to eliminate aliasing in shadow mapping. The principle is to sample around the current pixel (also called a fragment), then calculate the ratio of the sample closer to the lights compared to the fragment, use this ratio to scale the scattered light and specular light, and then color the fragment to blur the shadow edges.

Cocos Creator currently supports 5x, 9x, and 25x sampling. The larger the magnification, the larger the sampling area and the more blurred the shadow edges.

#### AutoAdapt Adaptive Shadow Calculation

AutoAdapt adaptive shadow calculation will automatically calculate the range of shadows created under the lightView, as well as the distance of the shadow camera.

## Support dynamic batching to improve performance

For models with `instancing` enabled in the material, the planar shadows will be drawn using `instancing` automatically as well. Please refer to the [Dynamic Batching](../../../engine/renderable/model-component.md#about-dynamic-batching) documentation for details.
