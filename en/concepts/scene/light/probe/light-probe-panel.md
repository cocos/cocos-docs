# Light Probe Panel

From the top menu of the editor, select **Projects** -> **Light Baking** -> **Light Probe** to open the Light Probe Baking Panel.

The **Light Baking Panel** will bake the [light-probe](light-probe.md) already laid out in the **Scene Editor**. After baking, the indirect light information of the static object will be recorded to the storage medium; all nodes configured with the **Movable** property will have access to more detailed and realistic indirect light effects.

## Properties

| Properties | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **GIScale** | GI([Global Illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination))scale factor |
| **GISample** | GI sample count of each light probe |
| **Bounces** | Number of light bounces, in the range [1, 4] <br> The meaning of bounce is the process of the current light source hitting an object and bouncing back to the probe. <br> If the number of light bounces exceeds this property, it will not be recorded in the baking result |
| **Reduceing Ringing** | In some cases, the light from the light probe may penetrate from bright to dark areas thus forming a ring. Modifying this property may improve the situation, but may result in unrealistic lighting |
| **Show Probe** | Whether to show light probes <br> The node with the **LightProbeGroup** component needs to be selected in the **Hierarchy** <br> ![probe](light-probe-panel/probe.png) |
| **Show Wireframe** | Whether to display the connection between light probes <br> The node with the **LightProbeGroup** component needs to be selected in the **Hierarchy** <br> ![wireframe](light-probe-panel/wireframe.png) |
| **Show Convex** | Whether to display the convex wrapping frame and vertex normals <br> The node with the **LightProbeGroup** component needs to be selected in the **Hierarchy** <br> ![convex](light-probe-panel/convex.png)|
| **Bake Light Probe** | Bake light probes |
| **Clear Result** | Clear bake results |
| **Cancel** | Cancel the baking process, this button will only be enabled when **Bake Light Probe** is clicked |

## Sample

Click **Bake Light Probe** to bake the light probe, and click **Clear Result** to clear the baked result.

You can click **Cancel** to cancel the baking process.

The progress of baking can be viewed in the information panel below.

Developers can also use the **Show Probe**, **Show Wireframe**, and **Show Convex** options to see within the scene if the probe matches the expected results.

See the [IBL Example](example.md) to see the art workflow.
