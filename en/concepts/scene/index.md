# Scene Creation Workflow

A scene is an abstract collection of environmental factors in a game, a local unit for creating a game environment. Game developers represent a part of the game's world content by creating a scene in the editor.

## Scene Structure

Cocos Creator implements a free scene structure using a node tree and a node component system. The **Node** is responsible for managing the parent-child relationship of the node tree and the spatial matrix transformation **Transform**, so that all entity nodes can be easily managed and placed in the scene.

The component system gives nodes a variety of advanced features, such as **MeshRenderer** component, **Animation** component, **Light** component, **Terrain** component, and more. One of the necessary elements of the 3D scene is the **Camera** component, which represents the player's viewpoint in the game, without which nothing can be seen. Therefore, when creating a scene, Creator will create a node with the **Camera** component mounted by default.
