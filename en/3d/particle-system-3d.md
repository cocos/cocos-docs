# 3D Particle System

Cocos Creator has added support for 3D particles in v2.3, with basics functions of 3D particle. Features are basically the same as in Creator 3D，there are currently dozens of modules to choose from, including Shape, Color, Velocity, Size, Sequence Frame, Trailing, and so on. But there are differences in version functionality, we will continue to improve synchronization in the future，align with Creator 3D gradually. The differences are as follows:

1. The switch for particle control preview in the editor is not currently available. You can view the preview effects in the **Scene** panel when the right mouse button is held down.
2. The `StartSize` parameter does not provide independent settings for X, Y, Z directions.
3. The `StartRotation` parameter does not provide independent settings for X, Y, Z directions.
