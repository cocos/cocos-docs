Cocos Creator introduced 3D support in v2.1, 3D features can greatly enrich the performance of 2D games, reduce the resource cost of 2D game. In Creator v2.1, 3D features such as 3D model rendering, 3D Camera, 3D skeletion animation, etc. are supported. At the same time, the editor natively supports parsing 3D model files in FBX format without additional import process,

**Note**: Cocos Creator v2.1 still does not support 3D scene editing and can only set parameters for nodes in the **Properties**. At the same time, 3D collision detection also has not been added, if you need to set the FOV and other parameters of Camera, please switch the Camera node to 3D mode in the **Properties**. (3D scene editing is supported in **v2.1.1**, and you can click the **3D** button above the editor to switch the scene to 3D mode for editing.)
