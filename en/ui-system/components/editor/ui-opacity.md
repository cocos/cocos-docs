# UIOpacity Component References

The UIOpacity Component records a transparency modification flag for the node, which is used to influence all the render nodes inside its sub tree. Normally it's used on a non render nodes, otherwise its opacity will be multiplied with the render component's opacity. The render nodes can set transparency individually by setting the alpha channel of `color`.

> **Note**: this component is only functional when its root node have Canvas component or RenderRoot2D component.

The method of use is as follows:

![ui-opacity](uiopacity/ui-opacity.png)

You can also set transparency by code. Example:

```ts
const opacityComp = this.getComponent(UIOpacity);
opacityComp.opacity = 157;
```
