# Slider Component Reference

Slider is a component for the production of UI components such as volume adjustment.

Click the __Add Component__ button at the bottom of the __Inspector__ panel and select __UI/Slider__ to add the Slider component to the node.

To use `Slider`, please refer to the [Slider API](__APIDOC__/en/class/Slider) documentation and the [Slider](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-test-projects/tree/v3.8/assets/cases/ui/10.slider) scene of the test-cases-3d project.

## Slider Properties

| Property     | Description |
| :------------- | :----------          |
| Handle         | The button part of the __Slider__ that allows to adjust value by sliding the button  |
| Direction      | The direction of the slider, including __Horizontal__ and __Vertical__ |
| Progress       | Current progress value, the value range is 0 ~ 1  |
| SlideEvents    | __Slider__ component event callback function  |

## Slider Event

For event structure you can refer to the [Button](./button.md) documentation.

The __Slider__ event callback has two parameters, the first one is the Slider itself and the second is the `customEventData`.

## Detailed Explanation

The __Slider__ is usually used to adjust the value of the UI (for example, volume adjustment), and its main component is a slider button, which is used for user interaction. You can adjust the value of the __Slider__ through this part.

Usually a __Slider__ node tree as shown below:

## Add a callback by script code

### Method one

The event callback added by this method is the same as the event callback added by the editor, all added by code. First you need to construct a `EventHandler` object, and then set the corresponding `target`, `component`, `handler` and `customEventData` parameters.

```ts
import { _decorator, Component, Event, Node, Slider, EventHandler } from 'cc';
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

@ccclass("example")
export class example extends Component {

    onLoad () {
        const sliderEventHandler = new EventHandler();
        // This Node is the node to which your event processing script component belongs
        sliderEventHandler.target = this.node;
        // This is the script class name
        sliderEventHandler.component = 'example';
        sliderEventHandler.handler = 'callback';
        sliderEventHandler.customEventData = 'foobar';

        const slider = this.node.getComponent(Slider);
        slider!.slideEvents.push(sliderEventHandler);
    }

    callback(slider: Slider, customEventData: string) {
        // The event here is a Touch Event object, and you can get the send node of the event by event.target
        // The customEventData parameter here is equal to the "foobar" you set before
    }
}
```

### Method two

By `slider.node.on('slide', ...)` way to add.

```ts
// Suppose we add event handling callbacks to the onLoad method of a component and perform event handling in the callback function

import { _decorator, Component, Slider } from 'cc';
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

@ccclass("example")
export class example extends Component {

    @property(Slider)
    slider: Slider | null = null;

    onLoad () {
       this.slider!.node.on('slide', this.callback, this);
    }

    callback(slider: Slider) {
        // The parameter of the callback is the Slider component. Note that events registered this way cannot pass "customEventData"
    }
}
```
