# Assets workflow

## Importing assets

There are three ways to **import assets**:

- Create a new file through the **Assets** panel in Cocos Creator. Use the **Create button** to start the importing process.
- By copying files, in the **file manager of the operating system**, to the project asset folder, and then open the editor or activate the editor window to automatically refresh the asset list of the **Assets** panel to finish importing assets.
- Drag and drop asset files from the **file manager of the operating system** to a folder location on the **Assets** panel. This will trigger an import of the selected assets.

## Syncing Assets

The assets in the **Assets** panel are synchronized with the project asset files seen in the **file manager of the operating system**. Assets are **moved**, **renamed**, and **deleted** in the **Assets** panel.
- If deleted in Cocos Creator, it will be deleted in the **file manager of the operating system**.
- If deleted in the **file manager of the operating system**, it will be deleted in Cocos Creator.

## Asset Configuration Information `.meta` File

All asset files will generate a `.meta` configuration file with the same name when imported. This configuration file provides the unique identification (**UUID**) of the asset in the project, small image references, cropping data of texture assets, as well as other configuration information. This data is a necessary factor in identifying a legitimate asset that Cocos Creator is using.

The `.meta` file is not visible in the **Assets** panel. When operating in the **Assets** panel, the **renaming**, **moving**, and **deleting** of an __asset__ will automatically synchronize the `.meta` file that corresponds to the __asset__ by the Editor. To ensure that configuration information such as the **UUID** remains unchanged, that is, it does not affect existing references.

It is not recommended to operate the asset file directly in the __file manager of the operating system__. If there is such an operation, please manually operate the corresponding `.meta` file along with the __asset__ file. The following suggestions are recommended:

- Close the editor you are using to avoid update failures due to file locks or identical asset names.
- When **deleting**, **renaming**, or **moving** assets, please **delete**, **rename**, and **move** the `.meta` file as needed.
- When copying assets together with `.meta` files, the copied `.meta` files will be used directly instead of generating new `.meta` files; if only the asset files are copied, a new `.meta` file with the corresponding name will be generated when you re-open the editor. This asset will become a new asset to the editor.

## Assets in Library

After the asset is imported, new data will be generated and stored in the project's **Library** folder. The structure and assets of the files in **Library** are engine-oriented and the format required for the final game, that is, __machine-friendly__, but __not human-friendly__.

When a library is lost or damaged, just delete the entire library folder and open the project, and the asset library will be rebuilt.

## How to locate assets

A asset has a unique **UUID**, used to locate the asset, but this method is not intuitive enough. There is another intuitive way: **Database URL** format, such as an `asset-db`. The corresponding protocol header is `db://assets`, the protocol header for `internal-db` is `db://internal`.

There are folder-level asset formats, such as `db://assets/prefabs/fire.prefab`

## SVN or GIT syncing of assets

> **Note**: there are line breaks in the `.meta` file. It is recommended to unify the line break styles and rules of the team members' computers to avoid opening the project after synchronizing the project assets.
