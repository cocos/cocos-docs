# Material assets

## Material creation

__Material__ is created as follows:

![material-create](material/material-create.png)

or

![material-create-menu](material/material-create-menu.png)

The __Material__ controls the final shading of each model. The __Material__ is composed of __Effects__, and the shading process of an __Effect__ is controlled by the __Material__. The __Material__ itself can also be regarded as a container of __Effect__ assets. The __Material__ can switch the __Effect__ assets to be used at will. The following figure is the __Effect__ asset of the __Material__ we have selected by default.

At the same time, we can also switch the __Effect__ of the current __Material__ by clicking the box to the right of the __Effect__ property.

## Effect Creation

__Effects__ are created in a similar way to `Materials`.

![effect-create](material/effect-create.png)

The created __Effect__ is a __PBR Effect__ by default.
