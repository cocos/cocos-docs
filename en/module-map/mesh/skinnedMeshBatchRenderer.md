# SkinnedMeshBatchRenderer

The SkinnedMeshBatchRenderer component is used to combine the rendering of all meshes controlled by the same skeletal animation component.

| Properties | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operation** | Any changes to the property will not take effect immediately and will need to be recalculated by tapping the **Cook** button before they can be applied. |
| **Materials**         | The "master material" used after the merge requires the use of your own customized merge effect.
| **LightmapSettings**  | For baking Lightmap, please refer to [Lightmapping](../../concepts/scene/light/lightmap.md) for details. |
| **ShadowCastingMode** | Specify whether the current model will cast shadows, you need to [Enable Shadow Effect](../../concepts/scene/light/shadow.md#Enable%20Shadow%20Effect) in the scene firstã€‚ |
| **ReceiveShadow** | Specify whether the current model will receive and display shadow effects generated by other objects, you need to [Enable Shadow Effect](../../concepts/scene/light/shadow.md#Enable%20Shadow%20Effect) in the scene first. This property only takes effect when the shadow type is **ShadowMap**. |
| **SkinningRoot**      | The root node of the skeletal skin, usually the node where the SkeletalAnimation component is located. |
| **AtlasSize**         | The edge length of the final set generated by the combined atlas. |
| **BatchableTextureNames** | The texture properties of the material that are actually involved in the merge, and the properties that are not involved in the merge, use the first unit's texture uniformly. |
| **Units** | The sub-model data before the combined batch, is the main data source. |
| **Mesh** | The model data of current sub-mesh, usually directly from glTF or FBX model file. |
| **Skeleton** | The skeleton data of the current model, usually directly from the glTF or FBX model file. |
| **Materials** | The "sub-materials" used by the current sub-model, which is a non-batching effect, the effect used by different sub-meshes should be consistent. |
| **Offset** | The offset of the current sub-model when it is merged, with the top-left corner of the atlas as the origin, in the range `[0, 1]`. For example, the data in the figure represents that the sub-map is overlapped with the top-left corner of the atlas. |
| **Size** | The size of the current sub-model, in the range `[0, 1]`. For example, the data in the figure represents 1/2 of the entire set. |
| **CopyFrom** | The target properties (except `offset` and `size`) can be copied automatically by dragging in **SkinningModelComponent** for easy operation. |
