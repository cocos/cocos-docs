# Using Cocos Dashboard

Upon launching the Cocos Dashboard and logging in with your Cocos Developer account, the Dashboard interface opens. Dashboard allows downloading the engine, creating a new project, opening an existing project, or getting help information.

The home page contains the Cocos product news, editor version news, and user's recently opened projects. Here you can quickly open projects, create new projects, install editors, get the latest editor version, etc.

### New Project

Creator provides a number of project templates, including basic architectures for different types of games, as well as sample resources and scripts for learning to help developers get into creative work faster. As Cocos Creator becomes more complete, we will continue to add more project templates.

Click **Templates** and **Examples** in the upper left to switch the project type. **Editor Version** is used to select the editor version for creating the project, and the drop-down box includes all successfully installed versions.

Check any of the project templates and at the bottom of the page you can see **Project Name** and **Location**:

- **Name**: The project name can only contain **a-z**, **A-Z**, **0-9** as well as **_** and **-**.
- **Location**: Click the icon behind the Project Path input box to select the project's storage path, or you can manually enter it in the input box.

Once everything is set up, click the **Create and Open** button to finish creating the project; the Dashboard window will be hidden and the newly created project will open in the main Cocos Creator editor window.

## Installs

The Installs page displays the successfully installed product editor, and you can import/install the editor version by clicking the button on the top right.
