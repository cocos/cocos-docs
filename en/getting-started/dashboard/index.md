- **Learn**: Help, a static page with information and documentation for beginners.

Creator provides a number of project templates, including basic architectures for different types of games, as well as sample resources and scripts for learning to help developers get into creative work faster. As Cocos Creator becomes more complete, we will continue to add more project templates.
