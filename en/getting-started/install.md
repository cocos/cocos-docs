## Sign in with the Cocos developer account

If you do not need to publish the game to the native platform, the above two simple steps can be prepared for you to use Cocos Creator game development environment for all development.

Cocos Creator starts, will enter the Cocos developer account login interface. Sign in to enjoy the variety of online services, product updates, and developer benefits that we offer developers.

If you do not have a Cocos developer account before, you can sign up for the Cocos Developer Center using the **Sign up** button in the sign-in interface. Or simply use the following links:

<https://auth.cocos.com/#/sign_up/register>

After registration, you can return to the Cocos Creator login screen to complete the login! Once you verify your identity, you'll enter the Dashboard interface. Except manually log out or login information expired, in other circumstances the editor will preserve your login session information so you can automatically login later.

## Version compatibility and fallback methods

When Cocos Creator is upgraded, the new version of the editor can open the old version of the project, but you may encounter some problems when you upgrade to a new version of Cocos Creator when the project is complicated. Because the engine and editor implementations in earlier versions may have bugs and other problems that can be bypassed by special treatment made by user scripts and setups. These bugs and problems may get fixed in subsequent releases and may cause impact on existing projects.

In addition to contacting the development team to find a solution, you can uninstall the new version of Cocos Creator and reinstall the old version when you discover a problem with this version upgrade. Problems you might encounter during the installation of an older version include:

- **Windows**: You may be prompted the error of installing an older version of the application if you already have an newer version of Cocos Creator installed. If you are sure that you have uninstalled the current version of Cocos Creator correctly from the Control Panel and still can not install the older version, please visit [Microsoft Official Fix Can not Install or Uninstall a Program](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed) help page. Follow the prompts to download the software and repair the damaged installation information, then you can continue to install the old version.
- The project is created or edited with a newer version of Cocos Creator. When you open it in older versions of Cocos Creator, you may encounter problems where the editor panel does not display content. Try selecting `Layout -> Restore Default Layout` in the main menu to fix it.

## Setup native development environment

If you only want to develop Web platform games, complete the above steps is sufficient. If you would like to publish the game to your native platform, please read the setup instructions for the development environment [Setup Native Development Environment](../publish/setup-native-development.md)
