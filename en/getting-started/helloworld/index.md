# Hello World Project

It's time to create and open the **Hello World** project.

Before we starts, please make sure you have read the [Install and Launch](../install/index.md), installed the Cocos Dashboard, and the newest Cocos Creator editor.

## Creating a new project

In the **Project** tab of Cocos Dashboard, click the **New** button in the bottom right corner to enter the **New Project** page. Select the **empty** project template, set the project name and project path

Then click the **Create and open** button at the bottom right to automatically create a project with an empty project template and open.

![editor](index/editor-panel.png)

- **Assets**: shows all the assets in the project's assets folder (`assets`).
- **Scene**: working area for displaying and editing the visual content in the scene.
- **Hierarchy**: shows all nodes in the scene and their hierarchical relationships in a tree list, all content seen in the **Scene** panel can be found in the **Hierarchy** panel with corresponding node entries
- **Inspector**: working area for viewing and editing the properties of the currently selected node and its components
- **Assets Preview**: Selecting an asset in the **Assets** panel displays a thumbnail of the asset in the **Assets Preview** panel. If the folder where the asset is located is selected, the thumbnails of all assets under the folder can be displayed for easy viewing.
- **Animation**: used to create some less complex animations that need to be linked with logic, such as UI animations.
- **Console**: used to display error reports, warnings or other log messages generated by the editor and engine.

For more information about the various editor panels, please refer to [Editor Panels](../../editor/index.md).

## New Scene Creation

Right-click in the **Assets** panel at the bottom left and select **Create -> Scene**.

Alternatively, you can create a new scene in the `asset` directory in the **Assets** panel by clicking the **+** button in the upper left corner and selecting **Scene**.

## Creating Objects

In the **Hierarchy** panel on the top left, right-click and select **Create -> 3D Object -> Cube**. Or you can just click the **+** button in the top left corner and select **3D Object -> Cube Cube**.

A cube will be created and displayed in the **Scene** panel:

## Adding Scripts

- Create a new script

  Right click in the **Assets** panel, select **Create -> TypeScript**, and name it "HelloWorld" to create a new script in the `asset` directory of **Assets** panel.

- Adding code

  Double-click the new script and it will be automatically opened in the script editor, provided that you specify the script editor in the editor menu bar under **Cocos Creator/File -> Preferences -> Program Manager -> Default Script Editor**.

  Then add the `start()` function to the script. The `start()` function will be called when the component is activated for the first time and will output "Hello world".

  ```ts
  import { _decorator, Component, Node } from 'cc'; const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

  @ccclass('HelloWorld')
  export class HelloWorld extends Component {
      /* class member could be defined like this */
      // dummy = '';

      /* use `property` decorator if you want the member to be serializable */
      // @property
      // serializableDummy = 0;

      start () {
          // Your initialization goes here.
          console.info('Hello world');
      }

      // update (deltaTime: number) {
      // // Your update function goes here.
      // }
  }
  ```

- Binding Scripts

  Select the created Cube node in the **Hierarchy** panel and click **Add Component -> Custom Script -> HelloWorld** at the bottom of the **Inspector** panel to mount the script to the Cube node. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the script directly into the **Inspector** panel.

  > **Note**: remember to save the scene after setting it up.

## Previewing the Scene

Once the simple scene setup is done, you can click the **Play on Device** button on top of the editor to preview the game. Currently, previewing is supported using **Browser/Simulator**.

![preview](index/preview.png)

Using the **Browser** preview as an example, Cocos Creator will run the current game scene with your default browser, as shown in the following image.

![console](index/console.png)

Notice the output "Hello World" in the log message in the developer tools of the browser.

## Modifying the Camera in the Scene

In the preview we can see that the cube seems a bit too small, so we can adjust the area of the scene by adjusting the Camera in the scene, which represents the player's perspective in the game.

- First, select the **Main Camera** node in the **Hierarchy** panel, and the **Scene** panel will display the transformation tool Gizmo and a small window with the player's perspective.

  ![camera](index/camera.png)

- Then drag the Gizmo in the **Scene** panel or modify the **Position** property in the **Inspector** panel to make the cube in the player's view window more visible.

  ![camera-position](index/camera-position.png)

- Then preview it again in the browser and you can see that the cube in the scene is now obvious.
