# Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Cocos Creator. Before learning how to use it, please refer to the [Installing and Launching](install/index.md) documentation to install Cocos Creator.

After installing the editor, it is important to become familiar with it, including how to create a project, the project structure, and the editor panels, by going through the following contents:

- [Using Dashboard](dashboard/index.md)
- [Project Structure](project-structure/index.md)
- [Editor Panels](../editor/index.md)
    - [Scene](../editor/scene/index.md)
