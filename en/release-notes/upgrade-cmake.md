# Upgrade CMake

Versions prior to v3.6 do not support specifying a cmake path, and can be upgraded by overwriting the editor's built-in cmake directory.

### Windows platform

1. Go to https://cmake.org/download/ to download the required cmake version, and extract it

![unzip cmake for windows](./unzip-cmake-win.PNG)

2. Open the editor internal directory `resources/tools/cmake/`

![editor cmake path](./editor-cmake-path.PNG)

3. Overwrite the editor's built-in cmake with the downloaded cmake content, leaving the directory structure unchanged.

4. Restart the editor and it will take effect.

### Mac platform

1. Go to https://cmake.org/download/ to download the required cmake version, and unzip it
   
![unzip cmake for mac](./unzip-cmake-mac.png)

2. Open the editor internal directory `Contents/Resources/tools/cmake/arm64` (or `x86_64`)

![editor cmake path](./editor-cmake-path-mac.png) 

3. Copy the contents of the downloaded `CMake/Contents` to the editor's corresponding directory. 

4. Restart the editor and it will take effect.
