# FBX Smart Material Conversion

FBX Smart Material Conversion is a feature of model importer, it can map some standard materials in DCC(Digital Content Creation) tools to Cocos Creator's built-in materials, and restore the visual effects of materials in DCC tools. This feature was added in v3.5.1.

The following materials are supported:

|         | Phong               | PBR               |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 3ds Max | Standard(legacy)    | Physical Material |
| Blender | N/A                 | Principled BSDF   |
| C4D     | Standard            | N/A               |
| Maya    | Lambert/Blinn/Phong | Standard Surface  |

Here is the comparison of a model using maya standard surface viewed in Maya and viewed in Cocos Creator after import:

| Maya Viewport              | Cocos Creator Viewport       |

You can refer to the following project file to see how the example model with Maya Standard Surface is imported. [Maya Car Demo](maya_car.zip)

## Smart Material Conversion configuration and import process for FBX assets

1. In the Cocos Creator main menu, go to Project -> Project Settings -> Model -> Smart Material Conversion and make sure the option is enabled.
2. Select the FBX file in Cocos Creator, and make sure the Smart Material Conversion option is enabled in the Inspector panel of the FBX file.

The following is the final settings:

## Different DCC materials support in detail

### Autodesk 3ds Max

- Material:The following material types are supported:
    - Standard（Legacy）
    - Physical Material (Recommended)
    - Multi/SubObject
        - Multi/SubObject's sub-material type can only be Standard or Physical Material, and can't be Multi/SubObject, otherwise, the material will be lost.
- Texture:
    - The following texture channels are supported for Standard（Legacy） material:
        - Diffuse Color
        - Specular Color
        - Glossiness
        - Opacity
        - Bump
    - The following texture channels are supported for Physical Material:
        - Base Color
        - Roughness
        - Metalness
        - Bump
        - Opacity
    - Texture simplification requirements:
        - Before exporting FBX, please make sure the texture nodes on the right side of the material are all Bitmap nodes.

Rendering Note: For Max Physical Material, you need to enable High Quality Rendering in Max Viewport to get a relatively accurate preview. For a more accurate preview, you can pair Max and Cocos Creator rendering environment.
