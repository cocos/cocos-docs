# Introduction to the Preview Process and Common Error Handling

This section introduces the browser preview process.

## Process Introduction

The browser preview is essentially the editor opening an express server that opens the user's default browser to access the preview URL when the "Preview" button is clicked. the preview template has some simple logic written in it for loading the engine and initializing the scene, while the loading of user assets relies heavily on the generation of `settings.json`, as `settings.json` contains the The current project's assets, scripts, and project settings are documented in `settings.json`. The preview `settings.json` is generated by calling the interface of the build extension, so if `settings.json` is not generated properly, select **Developers -> Open Build DevTools** to see it.

## Common Error Handling

When encountering a preview that does not display properly, first, open NetWork in DevTools to see if there are assets or scripts that failed to load at this time.

### `settings.json` failed to load

Before looking for the cause of this issue, make sure there are no error messages in the editor before previewing.

`settings.json` failed to load means `settings.json` didn't generate properly, so select **Developer -> Open Build DevTools** to see if there are any error messages. Under normal circumstances, there will be a corresponding error message if the build fails. If there is something illegal in the project script, then an exception will be thrown during the loading process and `settings.json` will fail. The specific script information can be found in the error message. Usually, the valid information in the error message is the UUID of the asset, copy the corresponding UUID to the **Assets** panel to search for the script.

For more information about the specific generation process of `settings.json`, please refer to the [Introduction to the Build process and FAQ](../publish/build-guide.md) documentation. The preview `settings.json` generation rules are basically the same as the generation rules with only debug mode checked, the difference is that the preview only sorts out asset information and does not package the assets.

### Asset loading 404

Please search the UUID of the asset with the 404 error in the editor's **Assets** panel for the corresponding asset.
