# Editing a animation sequence

After the __animation clip__ is attached to the __Node__, click __Enter Animation Edit Mode__ to enter the __animation editing mode__, and then you can create some __animation frame data__ in the __animation clip__.

__First__, it is important to understand about __animation properties__. __Animation properties__ include a __Node's__ own *position*, *rotation* and *other properties*, as well as the __properties__ in a __Component__.
The __component__ contains the __component's__ __name__ and other properties, such as `cc.Sprite.spriteFrame`. The corresponding blue prism on the property track is the __key frame__.

__Animation components__ can animate the __node__ and __component__ properties on the __node__ and __child nodes__, including __Properties__ in __user-defined scripts__. This means that various animation requirements can be flexibly implemented. The specific animation implementation depends on different animation needs and different steps. For an example case, please refer to the [official example-3d](https://github.com/cocos-creator/example-3d). This repository mainly introduces some common editing operations and facilitates rapid editing to achieve these effects.

## Modify a clip's common properties

**sample**: define the frame rate of the current animation data per second, the default is __60__, this parameter will affect the number of frames between every two integer seconds scale on the time axis (that is, how many divisions within one seconds).

**speed**: the current playback speed of the animation, the default is __1__.

**duration**: when the animation playback speed is __1__, the duration of the animation.

**real time**: the actual duration of the animation from the beginning to the end of the animation, corresponding to the number in the parenthesis in the lower right corner of the editor.

**wrap mode**: **Loop mode**, please refer to the [Cycle Mode](../../engine/animation/animation-clip.md#CycleMode) documentation for specific configuration effects.

Changes to properties take effect after the focus leaves the control.

## Common operations of node panel

The __Animation Clip__ defines the position of the data by the name of the node, ignoring the root node itself, and the remaining child nodes find their corresponding data through the **relative path** index of the root node.

- **Clear node data**: right-click the node item of the **Animation** panel, select __Empty Data__, and select __Clear__ after the pop-up window prompts

- **Copy and paste node data**:right-click the node item of the **Animation** panel, select **Copy Node Data**, and then right-click the target node item, select **Paste Node Data**.

![paste-node-data](animation-clip/paste-node-data.gif)

> **Note**: when using **shortcut keys to copy and paste node data**, please **make sure that no attribute track or keyframe is currently selected**. Because when there is a selected attribute track or key frame, the animation data will be copied first.
> If the paste target node does not exist when the attribute track in the animation data is copied, it will not be created automatically. Please create the required components in advance.

- **Migrating node data**: sometimes we will rename the node after the animation is completed, which will cause problems with the animation data, as shown below:

  ![missing_node](./animation-clip/missing_node.png)

  Next, right-click on __Migrate Data__ on the missing node, and then click on other nodes to migrate the data. If you do not want to migrate after clicking __Migrate Data__, click directly in the timeline area or click __Cancel__ in the pop-up window after clicking other nodes.

  ![moving_node](./animation-clip/moving_node.gif)

    > **Note**: by default, node data migration will overwrite the data on the target node

## Common operations of property track data

An __animation clip__ may contain multiple nodes, and multiple __animation properties__ are bound to each node. The data in each property is the actual __key frame__. The __key frame__ operation in the property has been mentioned above. This section mainly introduces some operations for the entire property track:

- **Add an property track**: click the `+` small button next to the __property list__, after the pop-up property menu pops up, click on the property that needs to be added. Example:

    ![add-property](./animation-clip/add-property.gif)

- **Remove property track**: right-click the property list item and select __Remove property track__. Example:

    ![clear-property](./animation-clip/clear-property.gif)

- **Clear track data**: right-click the property list item and select __Clear property track__. Example:

    ![remove-property](./animation-clip/remove-property.gif)

- **Copy and paste track data**: right-click the property list item, select **copy track data** or press __Ctrl + C__, then click the same type of track as the copied track, right-click will see the paste option, click or press __Ctrl + V__ to paste. Example:

    ![copy-property](./animation-clip/copy-property.gif)

## Common Key Frame Operations

In the process of __producing animations__, there are often some __manipulation of key frames__. There are a variety of __key frame__ processing methods in the **Animation** panel. Knowing these methods and techniques can help to edit __animation clips__ faster.

### Selecting a key frame

After clicking the __key frame__, the __key frame__ will be selected. At this time, the __key frame__ changes from *blue* to *white*. Currently, there are the following ways to select the __key frame__:

- Right-click a __key frame__ to select it, press __Ctrl and right-click__ to select multiple __key frames__.
- Drag the frame directly in the __key frame__ area to select the __key frame__.
- Press down the mouse in the empty area of the __key frame__ panel and drag to form a selection area to select all __key frames__ inside.

### Add key frame

To add a __key frame__:

- __Right-click__ on the corresponding property track position and select __Add Key Frame__. The current number of __key frame__ frames will also appear on the right-click menu.

    ![add-keyframe_1](./animation-clip/add-keyframe_1.gif)

- **Select the corresponding node and the corresponding property**, move the time cursor to the position where the __key frame__ needs to be added, and press the __I__ (inset) key

    ![add-keyframe_2](./animation-clip/add-keyframe_2.gif)

- Move the time cursor to the position where the __key frame__ needs to be added. In the corresponding property list item, click ![add-key-button](./animation-clip/add-key-button.png).

    ![add-keyframe_3](./animation-clip/add-keyframe_3.gif)

- After selecting the corresponding node and the corresponding property track, the editor control for the corresponding property will appear in the middle of the **Animation** panel, and the __key frame__ can be marked by modification.

    ![add-keyframe_4](./animation-clip/add-keyframe_4.gif)

- After adding the __property track__, move the time cursor to desired position of the __Inspector__ panel or perform scene operations to automatically generate __key frames__.

### Removing key frames

- **Select** the __key frames__ you want to delete and press __delete/Cmd + backspace__ on MacOS and __delete/Ctrl + backspace__ on Windows.
- At the position of the __key frame__ to be deleted **right-click**, select __Remove Key Frame__.
- Drag the __time cursor__ to the position where the __key frame__ needs to be removed and **double-click** the __key frame__, in the corresponding property list item, click ![Remove key frame button](./animation-clip/del-key-button.png)

    ![Remove key frames](./animation-clip/remove-keyframes.gif)

### Modifying key frame data

On the __timeline__ **double-click** the __keyframe__ that needs to be modified. The __time cursor__ will move to that position. Also, it can be directly added by drag the __time cursor__ to the corresponding position, and modify the corresponding properties directly in the **Inspector** panel. Make sure the **Animation** panel is in __edit mode__. For example, there are three property tracks in the property list: **position**, **scale**, and **rotation**. After the __key frame__ is selected, the **position**, **scale**, and **rotation** properties can be modified in the **Inspector** panel.

![edit-keyframe_1](./animation-clip/edit-keyframe_1.gif)

In __animation editing mode__, move the __time control__ line to a position where there are no __key frames__ on the timeline, and then modify the corresponding properties in the __Inspector__ panel, and a frame will also be inserted automatically.

### Moving a key frame

After selecting a __key frame__, __right-click__ and hold on the selected __key frame__ to drag, and release it to complete the movement. There will be prompts for the distance and the number of frames in the final position during the movement.

![Remove keyframe button](./animation-clip/move-keyframes.gif)

### Zooming a keyframe

After selecting multiple __key frames__, the left and right control levers will be displayed. Drag any one of the joysticks to move and perform zooming of the key frames.

![Scale key frames](./animation-clip/scale-keyframes.gif)

### Arranging key frames at specific intervals

After selecting multiple __key frames__, adjust the number of interval __key frames__. After pressing the button for arranging intervals, the selected __key frames__ will be arranged in sequence according to the set number of intervals.

![Spaced keyframes](./animation-clip/spacing_keyframe.gif)

### Copying/pasting keyframes

- A. After selecting the __key frame__, follow the normal __shortcut key__ __C/V__ to *copy* and *paste*. Note that the location of the __shortcut key__ __paste__ will start from __the current key frame__(The red line position).
- B. After selecting the __key frame__, __right-click__ on the selected __key frame__, select __Copy Key Frame__, and then __right-click__ elsewhere, select __Paste Key Frame__.

    ![copy-key frames](./animation-clip/copy-key frames.gif)

The copy and paste of key frame data supports cross-node and cross-clip use.

> **Note**: there is a difference between A and B. When using the shortcut key to paste the keyframe data, it will be pasted one by one in the order of the copied track data, while right-clicking on the target property track and selecting paste will only pasted on the target property track.Please be sure to copy the correct data to produce unexpected results.
