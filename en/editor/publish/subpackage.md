# Mini Game Subpackage

Some mini game platforms support subpackaging to divide resources, scripts and scenes. Including WeChat Mini Game, Baidu Mini Game, Xiaomi Quick Game, Bytedance Mini Game, Huawei Quick Game, OPPO Mini Game and vivo Mini Game.

Cocos Creator supports [Asset Bundle](../../asset/bundle.md) starting in v2.4, which allows developers to divide contents that need to be subpackaged into multiple Asset Bundles, and these Asset Bundles will be built into subpackages of the mini game. Only the necessary main packages will be downloaded when you startup the game, and these subpackages will not be loaded, but will be manually loaded by the developer during the game. This effectively reduces the time for the game startup.

## Configuration

The Asset Bundle is configured in **folders**. When we select a folder in the **Assets** panel, the **Inspector** panel will show a **Is Bundle** option, if set, the folder-related configuration options will appear:

In addition to the general [Asset Bundle Configuration](../../asset/bundle.md#configuration), the main settings to focus on for the mini game subpackage are:
- Set the **Target Platform** to the mini game platform that you want to subpackage, and set the **Compression Type** to the **Mini Game Subpackage**.
- The mini game subpackage can only be placed locally and cannot be configured as remote packages, so the **Is Remote Bundle** option cannot be checked.

Once configured, click the **Check** button on the top right and the folder will be configured as a Asset Bundle.

## Build

When building, the **Main Bundle Compression Type** in the **Build** panel should be set to **Mini Game Subpackage**. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Asset Bundle - Compression Type](../../asset/bundle.md#compression-type) documentation.

After the project is built, this Asset Bundle folder is packaged into the `subpackages` folder in the release package directory of the mini game platform. Each folder contained in this folder is an Asset Bundle.

**For example**, if the `assets/scene` folder in the Hello World project is configured as an Asset Bundle on the WeChat Mini Game, then after the project is built, a `scene` folder is generated in the `subpackages` folder in the release package directory, and the `scene` folder is an Asset Bundle.

> **Notes**:
> 1. Starting with **1051** version, **Quick App & vivo Mini Game Debugger** supports the subpackage loading of vivo Mini Game. Versions lower than 1051 do not support subpackage loading, but they are also compatible. If a subpackage is configured in the editor's **Properties** panel, it will not affect the normal operation of the game.
