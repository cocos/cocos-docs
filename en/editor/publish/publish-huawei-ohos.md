    ![preferences](./publish-huawei-ohos/preferences.png)

2. Open the **Build** panel from **Project -> Build** in the menu bar. Select **HarmonyOS** in **Platform** in the **Build** panel, and configure [Build Options](./native-options.md#build-options) as needed. Next, click the **Build** button at the bottom right.

    ![build](./publish-huawei-ohos/build.png)

    > **Note**: **Game Package Name** in the expanded option of **HarmonyOS** needs to be consistent with the **Package name** when adding the HarmonyOS application in the AppGallery Connect.

3. Open the project directory after the build is complete, notice that the `ohos` folder is generated under the `native\engine` directory, which contains the HarmonyOS project generated by the build.

    ![package](./publish-huawei-ohos/package-ohos.png)

    > **Note**: currently, HarmonyOS does not support multi-directory builds, so the generated HarmonyOS project is in the `native\engine` directory, unlike other platforms that generate in the `build` directory of the project.

    Next, open the `ohos` folder with HUAWEI DevEco Studio to perform further compilation, as described below.

### Compile and run through HUAWEI DevEco Studio

1. Open HUAWEI DevEco Studio, click **Open Project** and select the HarmonyOS project (`ohos` folder) generated after the build in the previous step.

    ![open-project](./publish-huawei-ohos/open-project.png)

2. Prepare the signature file. For the method of obtaining the signature file, please refer to the contents of the **Signature File** section below.

3. Configure the signature file. Click **File -> Project Structure** in the DevEco Studio menu bar, then select **Modules -> entry -> Signing Configs** and configure the signature information. For details, please refer to the [Configure Signature Information](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/ide_debug_device-0000001053822404#EN-US_TOPIC_0000001154985555__section19238119191816) documentation.

    ![sign configs](./publish-huawei-ohos/sign-configs-debug.png)

    Then proceed to configure the signature information in **Project -> Signing Configs**.

    After setting and saving, the configured signature information can be viewed in the project directory in the `native\engine\ohos\entry\build.gradle` file in the project directory.

    Depending on the build type (Debug/Release) and whether the generated `.hap` contains signature information, the developer can configure in combination as needed, please refer to the [Building and Creating HAPs](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/build_hap-0000001053342418) documentation for details.

    ![build variants](./publish-huawei-ohos/build-variants.png)

4. Then click on the **Build -> Build Hap(s)/APP(s) -> Build Hap(s)** in the menu bar to execute the compilation process and generate the `.hap` file.

    ![build hap](./publish-huawei-ohos/build-hap.png)

    After compiling, the `.hap` file with signature information is generated in the `native\engine\ohos\build\outputs\hap` directory of the project directory.

    ![output](./publish-huawei-ohos/output.png)

    All `.hap` files with/without signature information are generated in the `native\engine\ohos\entry\build\outputs\hap` directory of the project directory.

    ![output](./publish-huawei-ohos/debug-output.png)

5. Connect Huawei devices with HarmonyOS system using USB, then click **Run -> Run ‘entry’** in the menu bar or click the Run button above to run the HarmonyOS app to your device.

    ![run project](./publish-huawei-ohos/run-project.png)

    > **Note**: if the app icon is not found when running on the device, check if there is an `installationFree` field with `true` in the `native\engine\ohos\entry\src\main\config.json` file in the project directory, change it to `false`.

6. If need to upload and publish HarmonyOS apps to Huawei AppGallery Connect, please refer to the official [Release HarmonyOS Application Guide](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/distribution/app/agc-harmonyapp-releaseharmonyapp) documentation for the specific process.

### Signature file

HarmonyOS applications use digital certificates (`.cer` files) and HarmonyAppProvision files (`.p7b` files) to ensure the integrity of the application. First, use **DevEco Studio** to generate a key and certificate request file, and then use the certificate request file to apply for a digital certificate and profile file for publishing/debugging in AppGallery Connect.

#### Generate key and certificate request file

In **DevEco Studio**, click **Build -> Generate Key and CSR** in the upper menu bar to generate a key (`.p12` file), and then generate a certificate request file (`.csr`). For details, please refer to the [Generating a Key Store and CSR](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-guides/publish_app-0000001053223745#EN-US_TOPIC_0000001154985553__section7209054153620) documentation.
