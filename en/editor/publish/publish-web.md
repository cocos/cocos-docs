**Cocos Creator** provides page templates for two kinds of Web platforms. From the pop up menu of **Platform**, you can choose **Web Mobile** or **Web Desktop**. The major difference is that in **Web Mobile**, the image will cover the whole browser window by default, while in **Web Desktop**, you are allowed to designate the resolution of image, which doesn't change when you zoom on the browser window.

## Build Options

For some general build options of platforms, please refer to the [General Build Options](build-options.md) documentation.

- **Preview URL**

  Multiple Web projects can be previewed at the same time, so instead of a uniform **Preview URL** for the build, each build task will have a separate **Preview URL** that does not interfere with each other. Clicking on the URL will automatically open the browser for previewing, and the specific preview URL splicing rule is **${The Preview IP in Preferences panel}:${Editor preview port number}/${Build platform}/${Build task name}/index.html**.

### Browser Compatibility

The desktop browsers tested during the Cocos Creator development process include: **Chrome**, **Firefox** and **QQ browser**. Other browsers as long as the kernel version is high enough to work properly, for some browsers do not open IE compatibility mode.

Browsers tested on mobile devices include: **Safari (iOS)**, **Chrome (Android)**, **QQ browser (Android)** and **UC browser (Android)**.

## Retina Setting

You can use `view.enableRetina(true)` to set the high resolution in the script, and the Retina display will be turned on by default when you build to the Web platform. Refer to the API [enableRetina](__APIDOC__/en/#/docs/3.3/en/core/Class/View?id=enableretina) for details.

## Release a game on Web server

Click the folder icon button in the bottom left corner of the **build task** window,

If you want to release or share your games on the Internet, click the folder icon button in the bottom left corner of the **Build Task** window. After opening the release path, according to the current build task name, copy the entire contents of the corresponding folder generated by the build to your Web server. Then you can see the game later there.
