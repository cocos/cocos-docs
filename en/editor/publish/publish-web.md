# Publishing to the Web

Open main menu's **Project -> Build** to open the **Build** panel.

**Cocos Creator** provides page templates for two kinds of Web platforms. From the pop up menu of **Platform**, you can choose **Web Mobile** or **Web Desktop**. The major difference is that in **Web Mobile**, the image will cover the whole browser window by default, while in **Web Desktop**, you are allowed to designate the resolution of image, which doesn't change when you zoom on the browser window.

## Build Options

For some general build options of platforms, please refer to the [General Build Options](build-options.md) documentation.

Click the URL to automatically open the browser to preview. The specific preview URL stitching rule is `${The Preview IP in Preferences}:${Editor preview port number}/${Build platform}/${Build task name}/index.html`.
