# Extending the Database (DB)

There will be a lot of resources in the project, and the resources will come with a lot of data, which is managed by the resource database.
Extensions can inject resources into the resource database to provide resources like scripts, images, etc.
Through this article we will learn to inject resources into the resource manager via `contributions` to `asset-db`.

## Registration

Register Database as follows.

```json5
/// package.json
{
    "name": "test-package",
    "contributions": {
        "asset-db": {
            "mount": {
                "path": "./assets",
                "readonly": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```typescript
interface AssetDBConfig {
    mount:{
        //Directory of resources, relative to extension
        path: stringï¼›
        //Whether the resource is read-only,read and write by default
        readonly?: boolean;
    }
}
```

## Writing script resources in extensions

In order to write `ts` script resources in the extension, we need to copy `{project directory}\temp\declarations` to the extension directory.
This will give us the `cc` related script definitions.

## Importing extension injected script resources

Earlier we created a new extension `test-package`, which injects the resources under the `test-package\assets` path into the resource database.
Let's assume that the `test-package\assets` path has a script `foo.ts`,

```typescript
/// test-package\assets\foo.ts
export const value = 123;
```

In the project's script `bar.ts` we should import the script using the following way.

```typescript
/// bar.ts
import { value } from "db://test-package/foo";
```
