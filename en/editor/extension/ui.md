## UI Components Panel

The panel consists of two parts, the left column lists the UI types currently supported by the engine, and the right column provides some examples that developers can use as needed.

## Using in HTML

Using UI components in HTML is very easy, just copy the corresponding code into your HTML file and you are ready to use.

    - `min` minimum
    - `max` maximum value
    - `step` step length

### ui-checkbox

### ui-select

- Component `ui-select`
- `items` list element
    - `value` value
    - `label` display label
