# Extend Existing Functionality

**Cocos Creator** supports contributions between extensions.

When writing an extension, it is possible to query whether the existing functions in the editor provide the ability of receiving `contributions` externally.

If there are functions that provide the ability of receiving `contributions` externally, use these functions when writing extensions.

## Contributions Data Definition

The `contributions` function, uniformly defined in the `contributions` field in `package.json`, is as follows.

```JSON5
{
    "name": "hello-world",
    "contributions": {
        "builder":{ ... },
        "assets":{ ... },
        "profile": { ... },
        "scene": { ... },
        "menu": [ ... ],
        "inspector":{ ... },
        "messages": { ... },
        "shortcuts": { ... },
        "preferences": { ... },
        "project": { ... }
    },
}
```
