# Getting Started Example - Panel

In the document [Getting Started Example - Menus](./first.md) explains how to create a minimal extension, next we look at how to create a panel and communicate with it.

## Creating via templates

The quickest way to create a panel in Cocos Creator is through the **Extension template with a panel**, as shown in the following image:

![extension-first-panel-create](./first/extension-first-panel-create.png)

After clicking the **Create** button, you can find the extensions/first-panel extension in the project root directory.

### Compile, Install

In the command line tool, locate the extensions/first-panel directory and execute the following statement:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

After the command is executed, go back to the **Extension Manager**, find the first-panel extension, enable it and refresh it, as shown in the following image:

![extension-first-panel-enable](./first/extension-first-panel-enable.png)

### View Panel

After enabling and refreshing the extension, you can find the menu items in the **Panel** menu as shown in the following figure.

![extension-first-panel-menu](./first/extension-first-panel-menu.png)

Click on the **Default panel** menu item to bring up the panel shown below.

![extension-first-panel](./first/extension-first-panel.png)

This example also defines another menu item for communication in the **Developer** menu, as shown in the following image.

![extension-first-panel-sendmsg](./first/extension-first-panel-sendmsg.png)

After clicking the **Send message to Default Panel** button shown in the red box in the above image, you can see that the content displayed on the panel will change.

> **Note**: If this menu is not displayed, please open the **Extension Manager** panel and make sure the extension is enabled.

## Panel Explanation

In the following, we'll explain the panel directory structure, definition and communication mechanism one by one.

### Panel Directory Structure

In the project directory, find `./extensions/first-panel` folder, which is the directory where the entire extension can be viewed.

![extension-first-panel-folder](./first/extension-first-panel-folder.png)

As shown above, there are more `static` and `panels` directories than hello-world.

`static` - used to store panel layout files, such as css\html, etc.

`panels` - used to store panel-related source code, each panel has an `index.ts` entry source file.

`index.ts`, `style`, `template` Please refer to the documentation [Write a Custom Panel](./panel-boot.md)

### Description File package.json

Before we understand the panel, let's look at the panel-related definitions in `package.json`, as follows:
