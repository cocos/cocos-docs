# JavaScript and Java Communication using JsbBridge

## Background

In [JavaScript and Android Communication with Reflection](./java-reflection.md), We not only need to strictly declare package names and function signatures but also need to carefully verify the number of parameters to ensure proper operation. The steps involved are quite complex.

Therefore, we provide an additional method to simplify the communication between the script and the native. This method acts as a channel or bridge, and we named it `JsbBridge`, which stands for a bridge between scripts and the native app through JSB binding.

> **Note**: Both methods can be used effectively, and developers can choose the one that suits their needs based on their specific requirements.

## JsbBridge Mechanism

### JavaScript API

In the script layer, there are only two interfaces: sendToNative and onNative, defined as follows:

```js
// JavaScript
export namespace bridge{
    /**
     * Send to native with at least one argument.
     */
    export function sendToNative(arg0: string, arg1?: string): void;
    /**
     * Save your own callback controller with a JavaScript function,
     * Use 'jsb.bridge.onNative = (arg0: String, arg1: String | null)=>{...}'
     * @param args : received from native
     */
    export function onNative(arg0: string, arg1?: string | null): void;
}
```

As the names suggest, `sendToNative` is used to invoke code in the native layer, while `onNative` is used to respond to calls from the native layer.

When using these interfaces, please note the following:

- Since this feature is still in the experimental stage, it only supports the transmission of `string` data. If you need to transmit objects with multiple parameters, consider converting them to `Json` format for transmission and parse them before using.
- `onNative` Only one function is recorded at a time for `onNative`, and setting the property again will override the previously set `onNative` method.
- The `sendToScript` method is a one-way communication and does not have return value. It does not inform JavaScript of the success or failure of the operation. Developers need to handle the operation status themselves.

### Java API

In Java, there are also two corresponding interfaces: `sendToScript` and `ICallback.onScript`, defined as follows:

```JAVA
// JAVA
public class JsbBridge {
    public interface ICallback{
        /**
         * Applies this callback to the given argument.
         *
         * @param arg0 as input
         * @param arg1 as input
         */
        void onScript(String arg0, String arg1);
    }
    /** Add a callback which you would like to apply
     * @param f ICallback, the method which will be actually applied. multiple calls will override
     * */
    public static void setCallback(ICallback f);
    /**
     * Java dispatch Js event, use native c++ code
     * @param arg0 input values
     */
    public static void sendToScript(String arg0, String arg1);
    public static void sendToScript(String arg0);
}
```

Among them, `sendToScript` is used to invoke code in the script layer, while `onScript` is used to respond to calls from the script layer.

We need to implement the `ICallback` interface and use `setCallback` to register and respond to the specific behavior of `onScript`.

## Basic Usage

### Calling Java from JavaScript

Suppose we have implemented Java interface for opening an advertisement. When the player clicks the button to open the advertisement, it should be triggered by the corresponding Java interface through JavaScript.

We need to first implement an `ICallback` interface to respond to the operation and register it using `JsbBridge.setCallback`. The code is as follows:

```JAVA
JsbBridge.setCallback(new JsbBridge.ICallback() {
    @Override
    public void onScript(String arg0, String arg1) {
        //TO DO
        if(arg0.equals("open_ad")){
            //call openAd method.
        }
    }
});
```

> In actual projects, the above code is usually called directly or indirectly in the `onCreate` method of `AppActivity.java` to ensure that it can respond to all calls from the script layer.

In the JavaScript script, we can call it as follows:

```ts
import { native } from 'cc'
public static onclick(){
    native.bridge.sendToNative('open_ad', defaultAdUrl);
} 
```

### Calling JavaScript from Java

Suppose that after our advertisement finishes playing, we need to notify the JavaScript layer. We can do it as follows.

First, in JavaScript, use `onNative` to respond to the event:

```ts
native.bridge.onNative = (arg0:string, arg1: string):void=>{
    if(arg0 == 'ad_close'){
        if(arg1 == "finished") {
            //ad playback completed.
        }
        else{
            //ad cancel.
        }
    }
    return;
}
```

> In actual projects, you can place the above code in the `onload` function of a script component that needs to be loaded when the program starts to ensure early listening to events from the native layer.

Then, in Java, call it as follows:

```JAVA
JsbBridge.sendToScript("ad_close", "finished");
```

Through the above operations, we can notify JavaScript about the playback result of the advertisement.

## Best Practices

JsbBridge provides two string-type parameters, `arg0` and `arg1`, to pass information, which can be allocated according to different needs.

### 1. Both arg0 and arg1 used as parameters

If the communication requirements are relatively simple and do not require categorization, you can use `arg0` and `arg1` as parameters.

### 2. arg0 used as command type, arg1 used as a parameter

If the communication requirements are relatively complex, you can use arg0 as a command type to process different commands, and arg1 can be used as a parameter.

### 3. arg0 used as a command type, arg1 used as a JSON string

For particularly complex requirements where simple string-type parameters are not sufficient, you can convert the objects that need to be passed into a string using `JSON.stringify` and pass them through `arg1`. When using them, you can restore them to objects using `JSON.parse` for further processing.

> Since it involves serialization and deserialization operations of JSON, this usage is not recommended for frequent calls.

## Thread Safety

Note that if the related code involves native UI, you need to consider thread safety issues. For more details, please refer to:[Thread Safety](./thread-safety.md)ã€‚

## Sample: Multiple Event Calls

Cocos provides the [native-script-bridge](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-example-projects/tree/v3.7/native-script-bridge) example, which developers can download for reference use as needed.
