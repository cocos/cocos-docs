# why need config

Cocos website exists:

1. English: `http://www.cocos2d-x.org/`
1. 中文：`http://www.cocos.com/`

the gitbook be published twice, links are different on both. So add the config to adapt this.

## how to change

Config of the master branch will be for cocos.com, if you need to change config to cocos2d-x.org, only need run:

```sh
cd to docs root dir
> cp -rf config/cocos2d-x.org/ ./
```
